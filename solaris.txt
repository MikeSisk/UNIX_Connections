A Crazy little thing called Solaris

What is Solaris?

Solaris 2.x (which is what most people mean by "Solaris") includes SunOS 5.x and differs from Sun's previous OS (SunOS 4.1.3) in that it is derived from UNIX System 5 Release 4 (SVR4) instead of the Berkley Standard Distribution (BSD).

Why the change to SVR4?  I like BSD UNIX.

Solaris 2.x is more standards-compliant and compatible with the rest of the UNIX industry.  Most other UNIX vendors, including IBM, HP, SGI, and SCO, base their systems on System V rather than BSD.

Why do many people hate Solaris?

Most of the people complaining about Solaris are just not familiar with SVR4.  Many of the old BSD commands have either changed, moved, or just aren't there.  Also, the first release of Solaris 2.x (2.0) had quite a few problems and wasn't performance optimized.

What happen to the C compiler???

Sun has unbundled its C compiler and it must be purchaced seperately.  This isn't as bad as it seems since the compiler available on previous SunOS's was K&R based and not ANSI C compatable.  Sun's new ANSI-standard C compiler is now available as SPARCcompiler/SPARCworks.

Will my AutoCAD for SunOS run on Solaris?

NO!  You will need to upgrade to AutoCAD Release 12 for Sun Solaris SPARCstation.

Do I need a CD-ROM device?

YES!  AutoCAD for Solaris, as well as all OS updates and compilers from Sun, is only available in CD-ROM format.

Where has my XXX command gone???

Many commands have changed, we'll go over a few here:

	1.  df

	The df command now displays it's output in blocks instead of kilobytes.

	Here is df under SunOS 4.1.3:

	qa_serv_1:msisk:/home/msisk 72> uname -a
	SunOS qa_serv_1 4.1.3 3 sun4c
	qa_serv_1:msisk:/home/msisk 73> df 
	Filesystem            kbytes    used   avail capacity  Mounted on
	/dev/sd3a              15671    3769   10335    27%    /
	/dev/sd3f              91999   78517    4283    95%    /usr
	/dev/sd3g            1041470  154041  783282    16%    /files
	/dev/sd3d              19751      15   17761     0%    /tmp
	/dev/sd3e              19751    1214   16562     7%    /var
	
	Here is df under Solaris 2.3

	qa_serv_2:msisk:/home/msisk 71> uname -a
	SunOS qa_serv_2 5.3 Generic sun4m sparc
	qa_serv_2:msisk:/home/msisk 72> df
	Filesystem            kbytes    used   avail capacity  Mounted on
	/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s0      21199   15950    3139    84%    /                  
	/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s6     192423  158352   14831    91%    /usr               
	/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s7     625262   16271  546471     3%    /files             
	/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s5      60087   47110    6977    87%    /opt               
	/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s2    1255494  182324  947630    16%    /files1

	By using the -k option of df, we get an output in kilobytes that
	is similar to that of old SunOS:

	qa_serv_2:msisk:/home/msisk 71> uname -a
	SunOS qa_serv_2 5.3 Generic sun4m sparc
	qa_serv_2:msisk:/home/msisk 72> df
	Filesystem            kbytes    used   avail capacity  Mounted on
	/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s0      21199   15950    3139    84%    /                  
	/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s6     192423  158352   14831    91%    /usr               
	/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s7     625262   16271  546471     3%    /files             
	/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s5      60087   47110    6977    87%    /opt               
	/dev/dsk/c0t0d0s2    1255494  182324  947630    16%    /files1


	2.  ps

	The -aux flags to BSD ps aren't available.  The equivilent flags in Solaris are -ef.
